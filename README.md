# Question: How do you solve the problem of placing dominos on a board without overlaps? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of placing dominos on a board without overlaps. The board is represented as a two-dimensional array, and a domino is represented as a 2x1 or 1x2 array. The function `placeDominos` iterates over the board, and for each cell, it checks if the cell is empty (represented by 0). If it is, it then checks if the next cell in the same row or the next cell in the same column is also empty. If either is true, it places the domino on those two cells and returns `true`. The function `printBoard` is then called to print the current state of the board. The domino number is then incremented, and the process repeats until there are no more places to put a domino, at which point `placeDominos` will return `false` and the program will stop. This ensures that dominos are placed on the board without overlaps, from left to right and top to bottom.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a class-based approach to solve the problem. It defines a `Board` class with methods to place a domino and check if a domino can be placed at a certain position. The `Board` class also encapsulates the board's state (the `grid`), making the code more organized and easier to understand.

In contrast, the JavaScript version uses a procedural approach, with separate functions to place dominos and print the board. The board's state is stored in a variable outside of these functions.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations to ensure type safety. For example, the `canPlaceDomino` and `placeDomino` methods have parameters with specific types (`x: number, y: number, isVertical: boolean`). This can help prevent bugs caused by passing arguments of the wrong type.

Another difference is that the TypeScript version uses a boolean grid to represent the board, with `true` indicating a cell is occupied by a domino and `false` indicating it is empty. The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses a numeric grid, with `0` indicating an empty cell and a non-zero number indicating a cell is occupied by a domino.

Finally, the TypeScript version uses exception handling to deal with the case where a domino cannot be placed, while the JavaScript version simply returns `false` from the `placeDominos` function. This makes the TypeScript version more robust and easier to debug, as it provides a clear error message when something goes wrong.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is significantly different from the JavaScript version. The C++ version uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, while the JavaScript version uses a simple iterative approach.

In the C++ version, the board is represented as a 2D dynamic programming table `dp`, where `dp[i][mask]` represents the number of ways to place dominos on the first `i` rows of the board, given that the `i`-th row is in the state represented by `mask`. A state `mask` is a binary number where the `j`-th bit is 1 if the `j`-th cell in the row is occupied by a domino, and 0 otherwise. The function `countWays(i, mask)` calculates the number of ways to place dominos on the board starting from the `i`-th row and given the current state `mask`.

The JavaScript version, on the other hand, simply iterates over the cells of the board from left to right, top to bottom, and places a domino on the first two unoccupied cells it finds, either horizontally or vertically. It then prints the board and increments the domino number. The process is repeated until there are no more places to put a domino.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses features that are not available in JavaScript, such as classes and vectors. The JavaScript version uses features that are not available in C++, such as the `console.log` function for printing to the console and the `join` method for converting arrays to strings.
